<h1>EE 361L <br>
</h1>
<h1>Lab 5 Final Project<br>
</h1>
Update:&nbsp; November 9, 2010<br>


<h2>Deadlines</h2>
<ul>
  <li>December 7, 2010 TUESDAY to complete the project and demonstrate
to the TA.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Lab report submission deadline to be determined.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">You will build the five-stage
pipelined MIPSL
processor in verilog, which is a 16-bit version of the pipelined
MIPS described in the lectures and textbook (Chapter 4).&nbsp; It has
the same instruction set as the single cycle MIPS-L
of Homework 9.&nbsp; The components such as the ALU is the same as
in Homework 9.&nbsp; Note that all arithmetic and logic operations are
done in the ALU with the exception of sign extension,
shifting, and address addition (for branch address calculation).&nbsp;
Your computer will eventually implement all the instruction of the
MIPS-L of Homework 9 except the j, jal and jr instructions.<br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The are two parts to this project
that leads to 5 subprojects.&nbsp; (Note that the subprojects are a
continuum of tasks for each Part.&nbsp; Having subprojects makes it
clearer to assign grade points.)<br>
</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Information:<br>
</span></h3>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://ee.hawaii.edu/~sasaki/EE361/Fall12/Lab/EE361L-PMIPSL.pdf">Description of the
PMIPS-L0 and PMIPS-L processors</a>.&nbsp; 
  </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Part 1:&nbsp; </span>Implement
PMIPS-L0.&nbsp; This is a simplified version of the pipelined
MIPS-L.&nbsp; It has five stages of pipelined datapath but does not
allow instructions to be pipelined.&nbsp; In other words, only one
instruction is processed through the computer at a time.&nbsp; This
means that the processor will have bubbles in it as well as stalls for
instruction fetching.<br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Subproject 0</span>:&nbsp; For this
subproject, you can download verilog implementations of components of
the computer:&nbsp; data memory and IO, register file, multiplexers
(2:1 and 4:1), and ALU.&nbsp; <a href="http://ee.hawaii.edu/~sasaki/EE361/Fall12/Lab/EE361L-Subproject0.zip">Here is
the download in a zipped folder</a>.&nbsp; The folder includes the
verilog modules in the MIPS-Parts.V file.&nbsp; There are also three
testbenches to test the modules, and an output trace file (word
doc).&nbsp; There is also a instruction memory file IM1.V.&nbsp; This
will be used in Subproject 1.&nbsp; Notice it is a simple program that
multiplies two numbers.&nbsp; For this subproject, look over the
modules and test them using the testbenches.&nbsp; Also read the
description of PMIPS-L0 and PMIPS-L (under "Information" above).<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Subproject 1:&nbsp; </span>Implement
the PMIPS-L0 in verilog to execute the following instructions:&nbsp;
addi, R-type, and beq.&nbsp; Demonstrate your verilog code using
veriwell.&nbsp; It will run a simple program which multiplies two
numbers.&nbsp; Downloads will be ready November 4.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://ee.hawaii.edu/~sasaki/EE361/Fall12/Lab/EE361LControl.zip">Download for control modules (zipped
file)</a>:&nbsp; This has modules for a controller and
ALUcontrol.&nbsp; The controller is incomplete and the ALUcontrol
hasn't been tested and may be buggy.&nbsp; There is a README file which
you should read first.</li>
  <li><a href="http://ee.hawaii.edu/~sasaki/EE361/Fall12/Lab/EE361LPMIPSL0.zip">Download for PMIPSL0 (zipped file)</a>:&nbsp;
This has an incomplete version of PMIPSL0 and a testbench.</li>
  <li><a href="http://ee.hawaii.edu/~sasaki/EE361/Fall12/Lab/Subproject1.zip">Download for Subproject1 (zipped file)</a>.&nbsp;
There is a simple program in file IM1.V of multiplying two
numbers.&nbsp; It also has a testbench and a pdf file which discusses
implementation.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Demonstrate to the
TA for credi</span>t.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Subproject 2:&nbsp; </span>Implement
the PMIPS-L0 in verilog to execute the instructions in Subproject 1 as
well as lw, and sw.&nbsp; Demonstrate your verilog code using
veriwell. <br>

to the TA for credit.</span><br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Subproject 3:&nbsp; </span>Implement
the PMIPS-L0 described in Subproject 2 on the FPGA of the Digilent
Basys&nbsp; Board.&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://ee.hawaii.edu/~sasaki/EE361/Fall12/Lab/Subproject3.zip">Download for Subproject3 (zipped file)</a>.&nbsp;
    <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Demonstrate

  </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Part 2:&nbsp; </span>Implement the
pipelined MIPS-L, which we will refer to as PMIPS-L.&nbsp; It has five
stage of pipelined datapath.&nbsp; This processor will have simple
branch-untaken branch prediction, so it will have the ability to flush
the pipeline.&nbsp; It will also check consecutive instructions to
determine when it can insert bubbles.<br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Subproject 4</span>:&nbsp;
Implement the PMIPS-L in verilog.&nbsp; Demonstrate your verilog code
using veriwell by having your computer run program IM1.V from
Subproject 1.<br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Subproject 5:</span>&nbsp;
Implement the PMIPS-L in verilog and on the FPGA of the Digilent Basys
Board. Have your computer run program IM3.V from Subproject 3.<br>

<h2>Grading<br>
</h2>
The total points for this lab is 40.&nbsp; <br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Writing Style</span>:&nbsp;
20 points is for writing style of the written report</li>
  <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MIPS-L Implementation</span>:&nbsp;
20 points depends on the capabilities of
the multicycle MIPS-L you implement in verilog.&nbsp; You must
demonstrate
to your TA that you have completed your subprojects.<br>
